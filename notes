Requirements:

  The web site needs 

   * python 2.7 from here https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.7/

   * google app engine (if you want to run the devserver) 
     get it here here https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads

  The desktop client needs python and wxpython

   * You can get wxpython here.
     http://www.wxpython.org/download.php



Web Site Notes: 

  To run the test server..
   ./google_appengine/dev_appserver.py bobble-tea

  Management console is on:
    localhost:8000/

  Website is on (the db is empty to start with):
    localhost:8080/ 
  
  To populate the db with some data go to:  
    localhost:8080/reset

  Can login as one of three users: 
    scott, blaize, phil passwords are the usernames respectively

  Data is stored in ndb, c.f. (mocked for the dev server)
    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/

  It's running on the web here:
     http://bubble-tea.appspot.com/
  or test for mobile phones here: (It needs layout work .. I'm way out of time).
     http://mobiletest.me/iphone_5_emulator/#u=http://bubble-tea.appspot.com/



Desktop Client Notes: 

  cd to bubble_tea_admin directory
  run python main.py
